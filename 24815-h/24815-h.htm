<hr class="title" />

<p>The present study is an extension of a thesis, presented to the
Faculty of the Department of Philosophy of the University of Pennsylvania
in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of
Doctor of Philosophy. The object has been to treat the material in
the early American magazines which gave readers information about
Germany and other Teutonic countries. While the primary aim has
been to discuss the translations of poetry and the original poems
bearing on the subject, all relevant prose articles have also been
listed. Since many of the magazines used are extremely rare and
almost unique, the texts from them are here reprinted in order to
make such information accessible. As some of the translations and
poems, however, have been traced to Thomas Campbell, Sir Walter
Scott, William Wordsworth, Thomas Gray and others, whose works
are to be found in almost any library, reprinting was unnecessary
in these cases. M.&nbsp;G. Lewis' <i>Tales of Terror and Wonder</i> has
had, besides many early imprints, a recent edition by Henry Morley
in 1887 and the poems from it that appeared in the American magazines
are here mentioned by title only, the one exception being <i>The
Erl-King</i>, which is included because of several variants. Long
poems like <i>The Wanderer of Switzerland</i> (which itself would make
a small book) are not reprinted.</p>

<p>Parts II to V are arranged chronologically, so as to show the
gradual growth of the German influence. Translations and poems
are therefore reprinted under the date of their first appearance; later
publications of them in the magazines are here recorded simply by
title, with a note giving the earliest date. The texts are reprinted
exactly as they appeared in the early American periodicals, thus presenting
the information about Germany in the same form in which
readers of a century ago received it. Mistakes are often interesting
as illustrative of an ignorance about German names and words.
Only the most evident typographical errors have been corrected,
such as "spweep" for "sweep," "bilssful" for "blissful," and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
"fustain" for "sustain." Differences due to eighteenth century
orthography are retained.</p>

<p>The subject has been investigated to the end of the year 1840, but
this volume treats only the period ending with 1810. Often for the
sake of complete lists, however, poems of a later date are mentioned.
Throughout Parts II to V, notes by the present author, except mention
of sources from which the reprints are made, are inclosed in
brackets.</p>

<p>The courtesy and assistance rendered in obtaining the magazines
make me indebted to the attendants in the various libraries visited,
particularly to Mr. Allan B. Slauson, of the Library of Congress.
I wish to thank Professor Daniel B. Shumway, of the University
of Pennsylvania, for helpful criticism, and Professor John L. Haney,
of the Philadelphia Central High School, for valuable information
about the German literary influence in England during the period
under discussion and for improvements suggested in the preparation
of the Introduction.</p>

<p>I am especially indebted to Professor Marion D. Learned, of the
University of Pennsylvania, at whose suggestion and under whose
inspiration the present investigation has been carried on.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[1]</a></span></h2>


<p>The important influence which German literature has exercised on
American culture and literature extends from the early part of the
nineteenth century. This influence was, in a measure, a continuation
of the interest and activity that had existed in England during the
last quarter of the eighteenth century. Prior to 1790, numerous
translations from Gellert, Wieland, Klopstock, Lessing, Goethe and
Schiller appeared from time to time, but it was not until William
Taylor of Norwich began to write, that the movement, which culminated
in the works of Coleridge, Carlyle and others, assumed
definite form.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>American literature at this time was still subservient to that of
England and it is not surprising that the new literary impulse from
Germany should have found reflection on this side of the Atlantic.
This foreign influence was further aided by direct contact with Europe.
By the second or third decade of the last century the studies
of American scholars abroad became an important factor in our intellectual
development. In 1819 Edward Everett returned from
Europe to become professor of Greek at Harvard University. He
had studied at the University of G&ouml;ttingen, where he had become
enthusiastic for the methods of German scholarship. While in
Europe he secured for Harvard College a large number of German
books, which soon proved to be a stimulus to the students of the
institution. In 1823 W.&nbsp;E. Channing in his <i>Remarks on National
Literature</i> advocated the study of French and German authors, so
that our literature might attain a position of independence from that
of England.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Two years later, in 1825, Karl Follen entered upon
his duties at Harvard College as instructor in German.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>Before Edward Everett went abroad to study, however, American
scholars had begun to seek wider cultural advantages at the centres
of learning in Europe.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> They were mostly theological students, or
men more or less closely connected with the diplomatic service. The
most prominent among the latter class was John Quincy Adams, who
spent several years in Europe. His interest in German literature is
shown by the fact that he translated Wieland's <i>Oberon</i>, which however
was not published, because Sotheby's translation had just appeared
in London.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>A little later, in 1809, Alexander Hill Everett went to Russia as
secretary to the legation and spent several years in different cities
on the continent.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> George Ticknor visited Germany in 1815 to prepare
for his duties as professor of modern languages at Harvard;
and George Bancroft, after graduating from college in 1817, studied
for five years at G&ouml;ttingen, Heidelberg and Berlin. Henry E.
Dwight was at G&ouml;ttingen from 1824-1828 and in the next year
published in New York <i>Travels in the North of Germany, 1825-6</i>.
It was about this time that James Fenimore Cooper began his
European travels, which lasted from 1826 to 1833.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Thus, American
scholars had been acquiring German thought and culture at first
hand, before Longfellow or Emerson went abroad for the first time.
With these two the German influence in America reached its height&mdash;Longfellow
in literature, and Emerson in his transcendental
philosophy.</p>

<p>This was the second channel by which German literature became
known in this country. The first, as has already been indicated,
came indirectly through England. There, considerable activity in
this line had been manifest since 1790. Books of translations were
published and the magazines contained many fugitive pieces from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>the German. It is chiefly a reflex of this interest that we find in
American periodicals to the end of 1810.</p>

<p>In America, likewise, German literature was made known to English
readers by means of translations either in book form or in the
magazines. The subject of translations in book form has been
treated in the recent article by Wilkens already mentioned. He discusses
German drama, fiction, poetry, philosophy, theology and
pedagogy, and gives in an appendix "A List of the Translations of
German Literature that were printed in the United States before
1826." These books, however, were not the first means of introducing
German authors to American readers. The first mention of
this foreign literature we find, as a rule, in the magazines. Here
are numerous accounts of the lives of German writers, criticism of
their books, notices of editions (English or American) and besides
these, many translations of poetry and the shorter prose works.
These articles or translations do not, of course, antedate the earliest
appearance of the same works in England, but it is safe to say that
whatever information on German literature was offered in the American
magazines reached the American public sooner than the copies
of an English book sent over here to be sold. Many readers learned
to know foreign literature through the medium of the periodicals
who would not think of purchasing all the books, of which they had
read reviews or selections. This was especially true of the poetry.
The prose works were usually too long for republication in the magazines
and could be announced only through critiques or abstracts.
Even here, however, some of the longer pieces appeared, such as
<i>The Apparitionist</i> (Schiller's <i>Geisterseher</i>) in the <i>N.&nbsp;Y. Weekly
Mag.</i>, I-16, etc., 1795, N.&nbsp;Y., and in the same magazine II-4, etc.,
Tschink's <i>Victim of Magical Delusion</i>, while <i>The Mirror of Taste
and Dramatic Censor</i>, I, 1810, contains <i>Emilia Galotti</i>, translated by
Miss Fanny Holcroft. These prose pieces, being long, were continued
from number to number, but for the poetry this was not necessary.
Poems of the size of Klopstock's <i>Messiah</i> or Gessner's
<i>Death of Abel</i> appeared in the magazines only in selections or extracts,
while on the other hand most of the lyric poems, being short,
could very easily be reprinted entire in translation. With hardly an
exception, the short poems of German authors appeared in America
in the periodicals some time before they were issued in book form;
for example, the earliest publication of Gessner's <i>Idyls</i> mentioned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
by Wilkens was in 1802,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> whereas single idyls had been translated
for the magazines in 1774, 1775, 1792, 1795, 1798, 1799, two in 1793,
three in 1796 and five in 1801. Similarly, the first American imprint
of M.&nbsp;G. Lewis' <i>Tales of Wonder</i> was issued in New York in
1801, while five selections in it had already appeared in the <i>Weekly
Mag.</i>, 1798-9, Phila.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> In addition to these there were found in the
American magazines before 1811, ten translations from B&uuml;rger,
eight from Gellert, five from Lessing, four from Haller, three from
Goethe, two each from Jacobi, Klopstock, Matthisson and Schickaneder,
and one each from "Adelio," B&uuml;rde, Kotzebue, Patzke,
"Sheller," and "Van Vander Horderclogeth," together with several
translations, for which the name of the original author was not given.
None of these were printed in book form before 1826.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The first translations of German poetry printed in America are to
be sought, therefore, in the magazines and it was here also that the
public received its first information about the lives of the German
literati. It is the object of the present study to consider the German
influence in the early American periodicals, treating especially the
translations of German poetry published in them.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Together with
these are to be found in Part III translations from the other Teutonic
literatures more or less closely connected with the German,
namely, translations of Dutch, Danish, Norwegian and Icelandic
poetry, and also original poems on German literature, history, biography,
etc.,&mdash;for example, <i>Ode on the late Victory obtained by the
King of Prussia</i>, <i>Charlotte's Soliloquy&mdash;to the Manes of Werter</i>, and
<i>Burlesque on the Style, in which most of the German romantic Ballads
are written</i>. To this has been added a list of translations of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>German prose, and a list of original articles on Germany, etc., so that
a complete estimate of the German influence in these magazines can
thus be obtained.</p>

<p>The scope of the present work comprises the American magazines
published before 1811. By the term "American magazines" is
meant all magazines published in English, whether in the United
States or Canada. Periodicals in German, Spanish, French or other
foreign languages have been excluded. In as much as the study is
primarily concerned with literature it has been necessary, on account
of the great scope of the subject, to omit publications of a non-literary
type, e.&nbsp;g., newspapers, gazettes, periodicals dealing solely with
history, religious magazines, almanacs, etc. This method of exclusion
is not an easy one, for during the period under discussion the
magazine and the newspaper approached each other, the former
printed news and the latter gave specimens of literature, usually short
poems. It happened sometimes that a translation which appeared
in a magazine had been printed first in a newspaper. For example,
<i>The Name Unknown</i>, "Imitated from Klopstock's ode to his future
mistress. By Thomas Campbell," is to be found in the <i>Newport
Mercury</i>, 1803, Newport, just three years before it was printed in
<i>The Evening Fireside</i>, II-165, Phila. This illustrates the importance
of the newspaper in this connection, especially since the latter
contained also numerous paragraphs on things German, but it is a
field for separate investigation and in this connection must take second
place as compared with the literary periodicals.</p>

<p>Similarly the religious magazines often contain poems relative to
our subject, so that it has been necessary to include some of these
publications. Thus, the <i>Boston Observer and Religious Intelligencer</i>,
I-152, 1835, Boston, contains the poem <i>Trust in God</i>, "Translated
from the German," whereas others indicate on their title page their
dual character, e.&nbsp;g., <i>The Literary and Theological Review</i>, 1834-39,
N.&nbsp;Y., <i>The Monthly Miscellany of Religion and Letters</i>, 1839, etc.,
Boston, and <i>The Monthly Mag. of Religion and Literature</i>, 1840,
Gettysburg. Most of the religious magazines, however, belong to
the period after 1810.</p>

<p>Lastly, even some of the almanacs come almost within the range
of the present discussion, for the earlier ones have poems<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and interesting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>information, and were carefully read by the general public.
Most of these had their vogue before the literary magazine became
prominent and therefore represent a period before the German literary
influence had made itself felt. Of those that were examined,
none contained material to warrant their inclusion in the list given
in Part V.</p>

<p>Whenever periodicals were found to be of the types just mentioned,
they were omitted from further consideration. There are
two other kinds of publications, however, that have been included in
the present investigation. The first is the English magazine reprinted
in this country. Since it is impossible to exclude all translations
in American magazines made by Englishmen&mdash;as will be
shown later on&mdash;it has been found practical to take, as the basis of
selection, all periodicals actually published on this side of the Atlantic.
The only examples of this class that fall within our period are
<i>The Mirror</i>, I-II, 1803, Phila.&mdash;a reprint of a magazine of the same
name, that appeared in Edinburgh, 1779-1780, <i>The Connoisseur</i>,
I-IV, 1803, Phila. (London, 1755) and <i>The Quarterly Review</i>,
I-IV, printed in London and reprinted in New York, 1810. In some
instances the material in the American edition differs from that of
the English, so that it is quite necessary to include this class of
periodicals.</p>

<p>The other type of publications, alluded to, is the miscellany. It
contained poems, prose selections and articles on a wide range of
subjects. It differed from the magazine simply in one respect,
namely, that it was issued with less regularity. It offers, however,
valuable additions to the present collection.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Thus, even by omitting
all irrelevant publications, the field is a broad one and rich in important
material.</p>

<p>In any investigation of the early American magazines the difficulty
of locating copies is apparent. The editions of many of these periodicals
were small, especially if issued from the less important literary
centers; so that now, after the lapse of a hundred years, their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>volumes are extremely hard to trace. Another fact that aided in
the disappearance of these publications was their short existence. If
a periodical, like the <i>American Museum</i> or the <i>Port Folio</i>, ran for a
number of years, it became well known and its volumes were carefully
preserved. The libraries attempted to get complete sets and
thus the magazine was made accessible for future generations. A
large number of these magazines, however, had a precarious existence
for a year or more, and then were discontinued for lack of support.
Indeed, the many failures among these literary ventures cause
one to wonder why others were undertaken, and yet year after year
new magazines were launched on the market with full anticipation
of success. This certainly indicates a widespread demand for this
class of literature and if the kind offered did not happen to suit
the taste, the fickle public was constantly deserting the old for the
new.</p>

<p>The investigator is moreover impeded in his progress by lack of
definite and trustworthy information about these publications. There
is no complete list of the American magazines during the years under
discussion, although work has been done on the period to the end of
1800. Paul Leicester Ford published a <i>Check-list of American magazines
printed in the eighteenth century</i> (1889, Brooklyn, N.&nbsp;Y.).
This was an attempt to list all publications referred to by any writer,
whether accessible or not. The present investigation, however, has
brought to light thirty-five or forty volumes of magazines (including
twenty new titles), evidently unknown to Ford, not to speak of
several newspapers of more or less literary value; but the latter seem
to have been omitted intentionally from the <i>Check-list</i>.</p>

<p>Even the magazines of Philadelphia, the literary center of the
country during the eighteenth century, have not been listed. "A
complete list of the Philadelphia magazines is impossible. Many of
them have disappeared and left not a rack behind. The special student
of Pennsylvania history will detect some omissions in these
pages, for all that has here been done has been done at first hand,
and where a magazine was inaccessible to me, I have not attempted
to see it through the eyes of a more fortunate investigator."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> What
is here said of Philadelphia is equally true of Boston, New York,
Baltimore and the other centers of literary activity of a century ago.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
In spite of the difficulties just mentioned it has been possible, after
an extended search, to find enough volumes of the magazines to form
an almost complete list for the period in question. What omissions
there may be are, for the most part, obscure and unimportant publications,
which failed to attract enough attention to be included in
the large collections of this class of literature. One condition favored
the preservation of the American magazines; there were a few
institutions, like the Philadelphia Library Company, the American
Philosophical Society, and others, which were in existence during
the period when most of these publications were issued. It has
been possible for them to amass a fairly representative collection of
contemporaneous literature. On the other hand, more recent institutions,
like the Boston Public Library or the Library of Congress,
have displayed such industry in collecting, that they now have splendid
lists of these early periodicals.</p>

<p>The plan of the present investigation has been, therefore, to visit
those libraries where large numbers of the books needed are located
and thus, by combining the material secured in the different places,
to approach as near as possible to completeness. One library fills
out the gaps of another and it often happens that, in order to see the
entire set of a magazine, it is necessary to visit three or four libraries.
A record has been kept as to where the individual volumes are, but
as useful as this information might be for those working in the same
or in a kindred field it has been found too complex to be indicated
in the list of magazines given in Part V.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The material here included
is based on a personal examination of about three hundred
volumes representing one hundred and twenty-eight different magazines.</p>

<p>In treating the German influence in the American magazines, it is
important to consider the position which the magazine held during
this early period. Difference in conditions enabled the periodical to
play quite a different r&ocirc;le from that which it now plays. In the
eighteenth century, as compared with the present day, free libraries
were scarce and readers had to depend largely on the books they
could buy or borrow. Then, too, books were expensive, because
many had to be imported from abroad, and those printed here could
not be sold as cheaply as now. These conditions favored the magazines,
which were inexpensive and furnished to their readers, besides
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>original matter, republications of the best literature of Europe.
They kept the public abreast with the times and supplied the place
now occupied by the numerous libraries and books which can be
purchased at a moderate cost.</p>

<p>Another element which the magazine of a century ago did not have
to contend with so vigorously was the newspaper. The modern
newspaper is becoming larger and larger, and is making increased
demand every day on the time and interest of the public. In the
eighteenth century and the first decade of the nineteenth this was
not the case. To be sure, there were many newspapers, gazettes and
advertisers, but they were comparatively small in size, consisting
usually of only four or six pages. "At the period of the American
Revolution, journalism had nowhere reached [an] advanced stage
of effectiveness. In America, especially, the newspapers were petty,
dingy, languid, inadequate affairs; and the department of the newspaper
now devoted to editorial writing, then scarcely existed at all."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Many editors considered the news available to be sufficient merely
for a weekly instead of a daily issue. This is not surprising. With
the absence of the modern telegraph, telephone, ocean cable and
steam railroad the facility for getting news from a distance was
greatly diminished. Then, too, as the population of the country was
much smaller than now, the most important domestic news could be
told in a few columns. All this tended to keep the newspapers
within moderate proportions, and although they were numerous, it
is safe to say that they did not make such a demand on the reader's
time as to divert his attention from a more serious kind of literature.
People had, therefore, plenty of leisure for careful perusal of the
magazines, and these, by giving in many cases a summary of the
news, decreased the necessity for the newspaper. For advertisements
and business announcements the gazettes and advertisers were
the main source, but for general information and current literature
persons did not have to devote so much attention to the newspaper.</p>

<p>As far as can be learned, the magazine in this early period was
regarded in a more serious light than to-day. It was not a means
to while away an idle hour&mdash;something to be glanced at hastily and
then thrown aside. The editors attempted, on the contrary, to give
the best literature at their disposal, whether original or reprint, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>endeavored to improve the public taste by selecting matter that would
be acceptable to a scholarly audience. "A striking difference between
the older magazine and the recent ones is the conspicuous
absence from the journal of a century ago of what is commonly called
'light literature.'"<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Tyler mentions the same conditions. "Our colonial journalism
soon became, in itself, a really important literary force. It could
not remain forever a mere disseminator of public gossip, or a placard
for the display of advertisements. The instinct of critical and brave
debate was strong even among those puny editors, and it kept struggling
for expression. Moreover, each editor was surrounded by a
coterie of friends, with active brains and a propensity to utterance;
and these constituted a sort of unpaid staff of editorial contributors,
who, in various forms,&mdash;in letters, essays, anecdotes, epigrams,
poems, lampoons,&mdash;helped to give vivacity and even literary value
to the paper."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Considering these facts, it is seen that the magazines of the period
under discussion played a more important r&ocirc;le in the cultural development
of the people than they do now. They were not as numerous,
nor were so many copies of each number issued then as now,
but the population was also much smaller, and consequently a smaller
number of periodicals sufficed, although relatively they may have
been as numerous. One thing seems certain,&mdash;in the absence of so
much other reading matter, the magazine went into the home and
was perused with care by the different members of the household.
We have only to refer to the attention given to the almanacs during
a period slightly earlier, and these did not attempt to present as much
entertaining literature as the magazines. The prominence of these
literary periodicals in the development of American thought and culture
is usually overlooked, but should certainly be recognized in the
history of literature in America.</p>

<p>All this is very pertinent to the subject. The importance of the
translations and poems, here reprinted, in bringing things German
before the American public depends naturally upon the importance
of the channel by which they were introduced. From what has just
been said, it is evident that the magazine not only had a wider and
freer scope then than now, but also attempted to preserve as high
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>a literary and scholarly standard as was possible for that day. What
was admitted to its pages had therefore considerable weight and influence,
and became known at once as far as the magazine circulated.
It is for this reason that the appearance of so many poems and prose
articles relating to the German countries becomes so important, and
the interest here aroused was to increase many fold in the decades
immediately following.</p>

<p>The publication of translations of German poetry in the American
magazines indicates a twofold activity. In the first place it shows
active interest and enthusiasm on the part of a few individuals who
read and appreciated German literature and who had the ability not
only to understand the foreign poetry but also to translate it for
their fellow countrymen. How many there were who could read the
original, it is impossible to say, but these translators were certainly
only a small part of the Americans who understood German. In the
second place the appearance of German poems in the magazines indicates
a growing acquaintance with German literature, on the part
of the public at large. From the fact that the number of translations
increased from year to year we may infer that they found favor in
the eyes of the readers. Even if the circulation of the individual
magazines was small, the combined effect of so many must have been
considerable.</p>

<p>It may seem at first thought that relatively few poems have been
collected in proportion to the ground covered.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> There is a limitation,
however, that must not be overlooked. Only a small part of
each magazine was devoted to poetry and, after the original productions
and the republications of English verse (which naturally received
first consideration), German could only hope for its share
along with the other foreign literatures. It is remarkable how many
foreign literatures are represented in the sections of these magazines
devoted to poetry. There are translations from the Latin, French,
German, Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, Norse (Icelandic), Italian,
Spanish, Portuguese, Irish, Welsh, Greek, Laplandish, Persian and
Turkish. In all this mass of translations, German ranks perhaps
third as regards quantity; it is exceeded only by the Latin and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>French.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> This is true, however, only for the period to the end of
1810. The situation in the three succeeding decades is very different,
but will be discussed at a later time.</p>

<p>There is another reason why these magazines did not contain more
translations from the German. The period under consideration coincides
very closely with the classical epoch of German literature and
many of the masterpieces were not issued until near the end. <i>Hermann
und Dorothea</i> appeared in 1797 and <i>Wallenstein</i> three years
later, while <i>Wilhelm Tell</i> was not finished until 1804 and the completed
<i>Faust</i> (first and second parts) was published twenty-three
years after the period closes. The dates of much of the classical
German literature precluded the possibility of its being translated
until two thirds of the period had passed. However valuable these
works are, it is not remarkable that they should not have become
known immediately on this side of the Atlantic. For the Germans
here, the originals were all that were needed, and it naturally took
some time for the English part of the population to realize the worth
of the books and to demand translations. These causes, then, prevented
the German influence in the magazines from assuming larger
proportions.</p>

<p>The period treated in the present study is from 1741 to 1810 inclusive.
The year 1741 is chosen as marking the beginning of the
American periodicals of a literary type. The publications of an
earlier date that were examined were devoted almost entirely to news,
or were almanacs that contained no literary material, for example,
the <i>New England Kalendar</i>, I, 1706, Boston, or the <i>New Weekly
Journal</i>, 1728, Boston. These have been omitted from the list. It
is therefore not until 1741 that our period really begins. The two
magazines which were to be the pioneers of this extensive class of
American literature had been announced in the previous year. The
<i>Phila. Weekly Mercury</i> (Oct. 30, 1740) gives the prospectus of a
magazine to be edited by John Webbe and printed by Andrew Bradford;
while in the <i>Pennsylvania Gazette</i> (Nov. 13, 1740) Franklin
announced <i>The General Magazine and Historical Chronicle for all
the British Plantations in America</i>. A bitter controversy soon arose,&mdash;Franklin
claiming that Webbe had stolen his plans, and Webbe
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>accusing Franklin of using his position as Postmaster to exclude the
<i>Mercury</i> from the mail. Both magazines were issued in January,
1741; Webbe's journal, <i>The American Magazine; or a Monthly View
of the Political State of the British Colonies</i>, ran for three months
and Franklin's for six months.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> With these, then, the investigation
for the present subject begins. As has been indicated, the work has
been extended to the end of the year 1840. After that, German
literature was established as a well known factor in our intellectual
development, as is shown by the numerous books of translations and
imitations, and the magazines were, henceforth, less important in
this particular. The period here treated extends only to the end of
1810. These years witnessed the beginning of the movement and
the first period of considerable activity in this field. During the
years immediately following 1810 there was a decline in the German
literary influence in the American magazines.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>To estimate definitively the amount of literary activity in America
with respect to things German, as illustrated by these translations
and poems, would require considerable information concerning the
translators. If the translator lived in England and his work was
simply reprinted in an American magazine, the literary activity belongs
more to England than to this country; but the fact that the
poem was reprinted shows a desire to acquaint readers here with
foreign poetry, the only difference being that the influence came
through England and not from Germany direct. Where the works
printed are from the pen of an American, they represent not only the
ability of the writer to appreciate German, but also the active interest
to reproduce it for the American public; the translation is then
entirely an American product. As to Englishmen here doing
this kind of work, it would be of advantage to know whether they
were merely travelers or sojourners, or had been here long enough to
be considered an integral part of our civilization. However useful
this information would be, it is, in a majority of cases, unobtainable.
Most of the translations appeared without any indication as to authorship.
One thing that may partly account for this was the tendency
of the early magazines to copy and plagiarize. Scores of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>poems were found which had previously been printed in other periodicals
(American or English), but for the source of which no
credit was given. Even the author's name was suppressed. In one
instance an editor inserted a poem that had appeared in the very same
magazine one or two years earlier, and yet the readers were to receive
it as something new.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The only possible means of identification
in these cases is by comparison with published collections of
translations. Several translations have thus been traced to Sir Walter
Scott, M.&nbsp;G. Lewis, William Taylor of Norwich and others.
Many are reprints from English magazines, concerning which it is
impossible at present to give more accurate information. The subject
has not been investigated with respect to the English periodicals,
and since their number is far greater than the American, it would
require a separate study to prepare a list of translations from the
German published in them. It is, therefore, impracticable to exclude
from the present discussion translations and poems by Englishmen,
for it is only where the author's name is mentioned, or a note given,
stating that the translation was made for such and such a magazine,
that we can be sure whether it was an American product or not.
The important fact is that the translation appeared in America and
helped to make known to American readers certain specimens of
German literature.</p>

<p>In the selection of material certain limitations were necessary. In
the list of prose translations and articles dealing with the German
countries, everything has been mentioned which refers directly or
indirectly to Germany. This is important in giving a complete estimate
of the interest shown, for there was a desire to know something
about German prose works, German biography and history as well
as German poetry. From the list of translations reprinted here,
however, have been excluded all translations of dramas except certain
selections, such as songs or short scenes approaching the lyrical
mood. In most of the portions of dramas reproduced the passages
are too long for republication or the interest is wholly dramatic and
not lyric. The subject of the present study is, then, specifically&mdash;the
German lyric poetry which appeared in English in the magazines of
America.</p>

<p>The term "poetry" is here taken in a liberal sense and includes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>more than the translations of German verse alone. Some translations
were found whose originals, though prosaic in form, are poetic
in content. This was readily recognized by the translators, who
have accordingly given metrical renderings. For example, we have
<i>Letter LXI of the Sorrows of Werter Versified</i>; four of Gessner's
prose idyls have been rendered into verse, and in the later period
Krummacher's prose fable, <i>The Moss Rose</i>, appears five times in
verse (1819, 1822, 1823, 1829, 1831) and twice in prose (1827,
1833). Similarly, prose translations of German verse have been
included, e.&nbsp;g., two fables from Gellert (1796), <i>Morning</i>, from Haller
(1793), and the Swiss song, <i>Ranz des Vaches</i> (1805).<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> On the
other hand, prose translations of Gessner's prose idyls are recorded
by title only. Another poem of a different class must be mentioned.
In the volumes examined only one German poem written in America
was found. This was <i>Hoffnung</i> by "Adelio" and a note stated that
it was written "For the Philadelphia Repository" (Feb. 18, 1804,
Phila.). At the end were the words: "A poetical translation is
requested." The following number (Feb. 25) contained a translation.</p>

<p>Another group of poems calling for some attention includes those
translated from the French. These are of two kinds. In the first
place there are poems written in French by Germans or Swiss, such
as the poems of Frederick the Great, and also the <i>Ranz des Vaches</i>.
As to the latter, the French verses are given in two instances together
with the translation,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> so that it is certain what the original was. In
other instances no mention is made of the source. Since part of the
population of Switzerland has always been German, a German form
of the song very likely existed. It is difficult, therefore, to say
whether this or the French version was used by the translator. The
title is French but this might have been retained for the German
stanzas.</p>

<p>The second class of translations from the French comprehends
those from authors who usually wrote in German; thus, <i>Navigation</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>"From the French of Gessner" (1803), and <i>The Usurer</i>, "From
the French of Gellert" (<i>Port Folio</i>, XVI-245, 1823). Either these
may have been taken from French translations of the German,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> or
the word "French" may be a mistake.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> This second group has been
classed with the translations of German poetry (Part II); while the
first group from the French belongs to Part III.</p>

<p>No attempt is here made to discuss the critical estimate that the
Americans of this period placed upon German literature. This
would require a consideration of all the prose articles, whereas the
present study has been devoted entirely to the poetry. It is hoped
that, from the list given in Part IV, such information may be obtained.
Besides the several paragraphs on German literati, the individual
poems are often preceded by an introductory note praising
the original of the translation. Even back in the eighteenth century,
people were considering the utility of the modern languages as opposed
to the classics. The <i>American Museum</i>, for example, published
a <i>Speech on the learned languages</i>, by the Hon. Francis Hopkinson,
which concludes with the remark that the "languages most
in use are, in truth, the most useful to be known."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand there were unsympathetic writers who ridiculed
the Germans and their literature. The <i>Monthly Magazine</i> published
a letter entitled <i>Literary Industry of the Germans</i>, which decried
their pedantic scholarship in unprofitable directions.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> This attack is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>also expressed in the form of parodies, of which the following were
found: <i>The Wolf King</i>, a satire on <i>The Water King</i>, <i>The Fire King</i>,
etc. (1802), <i>The Paint King</i>, a burlesque on <i>The Cloud King</i>, <i>The
Fire King</i> and others (1809, 1833), <i>Against Faustus</i> (1804), <i>The
Squeaking Ghost</i>, "a tale imitated from the German, according to
the true and genuine principles of the horrifick" (1808, 1809, 1810),
<i>Parody on B&uuml;rger's Earl Walter</i> (1807), <i>Ode to the German Drama</i>,
"Parody of Gray's Ode to Adversity" (1806), and <i>Burlesque on
the style in which most of the German romantic ballads are written</i>
(1799, 1801). In some of these instances the parodies may denote
no real hostility but merely a rhymester's attempt to be clever.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that several of the poems in these magazines
may be grouped together, thus indicating particular interest in certain
subjects. Each group forms, as it were, a cycle, though the
individual poems were usually written by different persons. One
of these groups attests the popularity of Frederick the Great, even
before the American Revolution. The translations from his poetry
are: <i>Relaxation of War</i> (1758, 1795, 1798), <i>The King of Prussia's
Ode imitated in rhime</i> (1758), <i>A literal translation of the King of
Prussia's Ode</i> (1758), <i>Translation of an Epistle from the King of
Prussia to Monsieur Voltaire</i> (1759), <i>Ode to Death</i> (1786, 1806),
<i>Prayer of Frederick II in Behalf of Poets</i> (1805), and <i>A Song</i>
(1811). The original poems about Frederick are: <i>Winter</i>, a poem,
containing a reference to "great Frederick's noble feats" (1758),
<i>On the compleat Victory ...</i> (1758), <i>Ode on the late Victory obtained
by the King of Prussia</i> (1758), <i>On the glorious Victory ...</i>
(1758), <i>The Third Psalm paraphrased</i>, "Alluding to his Prussian
Majesty" (1758), <i>On reading in the publick Papers ...</i> (1758),
<i>The Royal Comet</i>, referring to "Prussia's great Frederick" (1758),
and <i>Mr. Voltaire's letter to his Prussian Majesty, Translated</i> (1758).</p>

<p>Another group treats the kings of the natural elements, so common
in German literature: <i>The Erl King</i> (1798, July 1833, Sept.
1833, 1835, 1836, 1838, 1839), <i>The Erl King's Daughter</i> (1798),
<i>The Water King</i>, a Danish Ballad (1798), <i>The Wolf King</i>, a parody
on <i>The Water King</i>, <i>The Fire King</i>, etc. (1802), <i>Hrim Thor, or the
Winter King</i> (1802), <i>Grim, King of the Ghosts</i> (1802) and <i>The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>Paint King</i>, a burlesque on <i>The Cloud King</i>, <i>The Fire King</i>, etc.
(1809, 1810, 1833). This interest in the weird element explains the
popularity of B&uuml;rger's <i>Lenore</i>, which appears in translation in 1798,
1801, 1804, 1823, 1836, 1839, 1840.</p>

<p>Switzerland is described in a variety of poems, treating all phases
of the life and scenery. The most prominent among them is the
Swiss song, which is variously translated as the <i>Ranz des Vaches</i>,
the <i>Cow Boy's Chant</i>, and <i>The Song of the Swiss in a Strange Land</i>
(1805, Oct. 15, Oct. 29, Nov. 1, Nov. 8, Dec. 17, 1808, June, June
3, 1809, twice in 1833 and once in 1835). In addition to the translations,
there are four imitations of the same poem: <i>The Swiss Exiles'
Song</i> (1835), <i>The Switzer's Return</i> [from America] (1836),
<i>The Switzer's Song of Home</i> (1837, 1838), and <i>The Swiss Emigrant's
Dream of Home</i> (1840).<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The last group of poems to be mentioned refers to Goethe's novel,
<i>Die Leiden des jungen Werthers</i>. This was evidently popular in
America, though by no means causing the widespread delirium and
sentimentality that had been rife in Germany. During our period
the book was published here six times in translation, and an English
imitation, <i>The Letters of Charlotte, during her Connexion with
Werter</i>, had three American reprints.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> These, together with translations
imported from England, must have made Werter well known
in this country. It is not surprising, therefore, to find in the magazines
eight poems on the subject: <i>Narcissa</i>, containing a reference
to Werter in the third stanza (1787), <i>Charlotte's Soliloquy&mdash;to the
Manes of Werter</i> (1787), <i>Death of Werter</i> (1787), <i>Werter's Epitaph</i>
(1787, 1791, 1805), <i>On Reading the Sorrows of Werter</i> (1790),
<i>Letter LXI of the Sorrows of Werter, Versified</i> (1791), <i>Werter's
Farewell to Charlotte</i> (1798) and <i>Charlotte at the Tomb of Werter</i>
(1809).</p>

<p>The early American magazines, then, were instrumental in making
German literature and especially German poetry known in America.
It was possible for them to print translations of individual poems of
an author long before there was a demand for them in book form.
Gessner, B&uuml;rger, Gellert, Lessing and others have already been mentioned
in this connection. It is interesting to note just what poets
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>were introduced to the American public by means of the magazines.
Gessner and B&uuml;rger were the most popular, the former appearing
twenty-five times and the latter ten times before 1811. Gessner
was perhaps the German poet best known in America. During this
period his <i>Death of Abel</i> had no less than sixteen American imprints
and four imitations, while translations of his <i>Idyls</i> appeared in book
form twice in 1802 and once in 1807.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> B&uuml;rger, on the other hand,
was known only through these poems in the magazines, or perhaps
through imported books. No volume of translations of his poems
belongs to this period of American printing.</p>

<p>After these, Gellert, Lessing and Haller had some share of recognition
both by translation and criticism. Goethe, as has been shown,
was known as the author of <i>Werter</i>. As for his lyrical productions,
only two appeared, <i>The Erl-King</i> (1798) and <i>Frederick and Alice</i>,
"Imitated rather than translated from a fragment introduced in
Goethe's <i>Claudine von Villa Bella</i>" (1807). Other poets, like Jacobi,
Klopstock, Matthisson, Kotzebue, Patzke or B&uuml;rde, found an
occasional admirer, but not enough was done to bring their characteristics
plainly before the public. In addition to these, there were
numerous parodies and original poems, which helped to emphasize
the importance of things German. This influence, moreover, was
aided by the translations of prose works and by articles on German
literature, history and biography, which are scattered through the
pages of these periodicals. The American magazines accomplished
considerable for German in this country. The movement here
treated grew until it assumed a widespread importance a few decades
later, but the period to the end of 1810 is interesting as marking the
beginning. It was the first epoch of this type of literary activity in
America.</p>

was in the form of twenty-nine letters to his brother, written during the trip,
and thirteen more added after his return to Berlin. Although they were
private communications, the editor of the <i>Port Folio</i> secured them for his
magazine and printed them anonymously, without suppressing personal references,
as the author would have done, had he known of the publication.
</p><p>
"Whether these passages ever came under the observation of the persons
affected is not certain. So long as they remained confined to the columns of
an American publication of that day, the probabilities would favor the negative.
But they were not so confined. Again, without the knowledge or consent
of the author, an individual, unknown to him, but fully aware of the
facts in the case nevertheless took the collection from the <i>Portfolio</i> to London,
and there had them printed for his own benefit, in an octavo volume, in
the year 1804. From this copy they were rendered into German, and published
at Breslau the next year, with notes, by Frederick Albert Zimmerman;
and in 1807 a translation made into French, by J. Dupuy, was published in
Paris by Dentu.
</p><p>
"Thus it happened that these letters, originally intended as purely familiar
correspondence, obtained a free circulation over a large part of Europe without
the smallest agency on the part of the author, or any opportunity to correct
and modify them as he certainly would have done had he ever possessed
the power."

<p class="poemtitle">THE MORNING.</p>

<p class="poemsub"><span class="smcap">By Haller.</span></p>

<p>The moon retires&mdash;Nature's dark veil no more obscures the air
and earth&mdash;the twinkling stars disappear and the reviving warmth of
the sun awakens all creatures.</p>

<p>Already are the heavens adorned with its purple hues and its
sparkling sapphires. Aurora, fair harbinger of the day, graciously
dispenses smiles; and brightness of the roses which wreath her forehead
dissipates the mists of night.</p>

<p>The flaming of the world advances from the eastern gate, triumphantly
treading on the shining splendours of the milky way;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
clouds covered with Heaven's rubies, oppose him with their lightning,
and a flame of gold spreads itself around the horizon.</p>

<p>The roses open to salute the sun with genial dews; and the lilies
exhale delicious odours from their sattin'd leaves.</p>

<p>The vigilant hind flies to the labour-giving field; he guides with
careful pleasure the earth-piercing plough; in the meantime his ears
are delighted by the lightsome band of minstrels, which sweeten the
air and the woods with their melodious notes. Thus doth benignant
Heaven lighten the heavy pressure of toilful industry! O Creator!
all that I see are the effects of thy power! thou art the soul of nature
and doth actuate every part! the stated periods and glittering appearance
of yon orbs, and the unquenched fires of the revolving sun,
proceed from thy hands, and boast thy impression!</p>

<p>Thou illumest the solemn moon to guide us amid darkness; thou
dost lend wings to the unseen wind, and by night thou dost enrich the
earth with fruitful dews.</p>

<p>From the dust thou hast formed yon proud-topt mountain; from
sand hast thou produced metals; thou hast spread yon firmament, and
thou hast clothed it with clouds, that it may remain unpolluted by the
exploring eye of man.</p>

<p>Thou hast wonderfully formed the veins of that fish which causes
rivers to overflow, and which makes whirlpools, and spreads devastation
with the flappings of his tail. Thou hast built the elephant, and
thou hast animated its enormous bulk, that it resembles a moving
mountain. Thou supportest yon splendid arches of the heavens
upon the vast void; and with thy word thou hast produced from
chaos this wondrous universe, filling it with order, and giving it no
other limit than its grandeur.</p>

<p>Great God! created spirits are too insignificant to raise the glory
of thy works! We lose ourselves in their immensity. To tell them
one must resemble thyself on infinity. Humbly contented, I remain
in my own prescribed circle. Incomprehensible Being! thy resplendent
glories blind the presuming eye of man! and He from
whom the earth receives its being, needs not the praises of a worm!</p>

<p class="poemtitle">FABLE</p>

<p class="poemsub">Imitated from the German of Gellert.</p>

<p>While a nightingale chanted in the midst of a forest, the neighbouring
hills and vallies were delighted with her exquisite melody.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Every wild bird forgot to sing, listening with fond admiration.
Aurora tarried behind the hill, attending to her musical cadences;
and Philomel, in honor of the goddess, warbled with unusual sweetness.
At that she paused, and the lark took the opportunity of thus
addressing her; 'Your music meets with just approbation; the
variety, the clearness, and tenderness of the notes are inimitable;
nevertheless, in one circumstance I am entitled to a preference. My
melody is uninterrupted; and every morning is ushered with my
gratulations. Your song on the contrary, is heard but seldom; and,
except during a few weeks in the Summer, you have no claim to
peculiar attention.' 'You have mentioned,' replied the Nightingale,
'the very cause of my superior excellence. I attend to, and obey,
the dictates of Nature. I never sing but by her incitements; nor
even yield to importunate, but uninspired inclination.'</p>

<p class="poemtitle">A FABLE</p>

<p class="poemsub">Imitated from the German of Gellert.</p>

<p>Clarine loved her husband with sincere affection&mdash;for he was a
husband to her mind. Their desires and aversions were the same.
It was Clarine's study to be agreeable, and by unwearied attention,
to anticipate her husband's wishes. "Such a wife," says my male
reader, who has thoughts of matrimony, "such a wife would I desire."&mdash;And
such a wife mayst thou obtain.&mdash;Clarine's husband fell sick&mdash;a
dangerous illness.&mdash;"No hope" said the physician, and shook his
awful whig. Bitterly wept Clarine. "O death!" she cried, "O
death! might I prefer a petition? Spare my husband; let me be the
victim in his stead." Death heard, appeared, and "What," said
the grim spectre, "is thy request?" "There," said Clarine sore dismayed,
"There he lies; overcome with agony he implores thy speedy
relief."</p>

<p class="poemsub">(From the German of Lessing.)</p>

<p>Believe me, my friend, the great world is not suited to philosophers
or poets. We are insensible to their real worth; and they, alas! are
often weak enough to exchange it for a mere nothing.</p>

<p>In early ages the swallow was as tuneful and melodious a bird as
the nightingale; but she soon became weary of residing in solitary
groves to excite the admiration of none but the industrious peasant
and the innocent shepherdess. She left her humble friends, and
removed into town. What was the consequence? As the inhabitants
of the city had not leisure to attend to her divine song, she gradually
forgot it, and in its stead learned to&mdash;build.</p>

<span class="i0">The rich and varied fruits of autumn's reign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall ope their treasures, in a bounteous train;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of these the best, with choicest care display'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall form a wreath, for thee, my lovely maid!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the fond shepherd, for his darling fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Culls beauteous flowers to deck her flowing hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The garden's rise shall grace my humble strains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If Daphne smiles 'twill well repay my pains!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas, in the morn of youth, a shepherd found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This happy art to decorate the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is the spot, the enamour'd Lycas cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lycas the young, the gentle and the wise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under this elm, fair Adelaide first gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kiss of love to her devoted slave!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst he, in am'rous accents told his flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With beating heart and agitated frame!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here faint and weak my charmer sank to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the warm pillow of my panting breast!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of all the swains that strive this heart to move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis Lycas only Adelaide can love!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye peaceful groves&mdash;ye solitary springs&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To you I oft confess'd my secret stings!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Oft have your leaves that round me clust'ring grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drank my warm tears as drops of morning dew."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart is full&mdash;what transport is my own!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, in my bosom, love has fixed his throne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sacred to love this spot shall ever stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deck'd with luxuriant beauties by my hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under this elm, the shadiest of the trees,<br /></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span><span class="i0">Around its trunk the woodbine too shall rear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its white and purple flowers aloft in air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The treasures of the spring shall hither flow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The piony by the lily here shall blow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the hills, and through the meads I'll roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bring the blooming spoils in rapture home:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The purple violet, the pink shall join,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The od'rous shrubs shall all their sweets combine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of these a grove of balmy sort shall rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, with its fragrant blossoms, scent the skies!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then round this little favour'd isle, I'll bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gentle windings, yonder silver spring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While eglantine and thorn shall interpose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their hedge, a rampart 'gainst invading foes&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest sheep and rambling goats the place annoy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spoil the promise of our future joy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh then approach, ye favour'd of the loves!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come and dwell here ye gentle turtle doves!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On yonder spreading branches, perch'd on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With coos repeated greet the lover's sigh!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sportive sparrows round the roses play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sing, delighted, from the bending spray!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye butterflies, arrayed in coats of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On beds of roses fluttering revels hold!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here rest, upon the lily's waving stalk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And add new beauty to the evening walk.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then shall the shepherd passing, free from care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When zephyr spreads the perfumes thro' the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inhale the fragrance, and with transport cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What hallow'd place is this? what goddess nigh?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does Venus own this gay, enchanted place?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or has Diana, wearied in the chace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chosen a spot where choicest sweets abound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To slumber on the consecrated ground?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The nightingale's enchanting tender note,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had held him bound in rapture's soothing trance.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Before his lonely dwelling formed a porch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of simple structure, deeply slumbering found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His venerable parent&mdash;his grey head<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With arms enfolded, and with swelling heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stood before his father&mdash;long he stood,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">How happy is my lot! the fav'ring gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must hear thy fond petition; else, why stands<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With ripening fruit? why, else, such blessings shower'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon our healthy, fast increasing herd?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the golden produce of our fields?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When oft the tear of joy bedew'd thy cheek,<br /></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span><span class="i0">Thy feeble age; when, towards the vault of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You turn'd your swimming eyes, and blest your son;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! then, what words his blessings could express!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My bosom swell'd with transport, and the tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'erflow'd my glowing cheeks&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When yester morn, reclining on my arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You left our cot to feel the quickening beams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the warm sun, and saw about thee sport<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frolic herd, the trees, with fruit o'ercharg'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the fertile country blooming round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My hairs grow grey in peace," were then thy words;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Fields of my youth, be ever, ever blest!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My eyes, grow dim, shall not much longer view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Your heart-delighting scenes, for happier plains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Must I exchange you&mdash;plains beyond the skies."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, father, best belov'd, must I so soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lose thee! my nearest friend!&mdash;distressing thought!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close to thy tomb, with filial love, I'll raise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A modest altar, and with ardour seek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each blest occasion to relieve the woes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the oppressed and wretched; on each day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That gives the happy chance of doing good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll pour sweet milk upon a parent's grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strew with flowers the ever sacred spot&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He paus'd but kept his eyes, suffus'd with tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fix'd on the good old man; then, sighing; said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How still he lies, and smiles amidst his slumbers!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some of his virtuous deeds must hover o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In peaceful dreams, and fill his cheerful soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst the moon pours her rays upon his bare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shining temples, and his silver beard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh may the breeze, and dewy damps of eve&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do thee no harm. Then gently did he kiss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His aged forehead, gently wak'd him up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And led him to his cot, in lighter sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On softest furs, to slumber out the night.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Ah, William! art thou false or dead?"<br /></span>

<span class="i1">"I dreamt thou'dst ne'er return."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">William had fought in Frederick's host<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Prague&mdash;and what his fate&mdash;if lost<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or false, she could not learn.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i1">Resolv'd to end the strife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And homewards, then, their separate routs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The armies took, with songs and shouts,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With cymbals, drum and fife.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As deck'd with boughs they march'd along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From every door, the old and young<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Rush'd forth the troops to greet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thank God," each child and parent cry'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And "welcome, welcome," many a bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As friends long parted meet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They joy'd, poor Leonora griev'd:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No kiss she gave, no kiss receiv'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of William none could tell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She rung her hands, and tore her hair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till left alone in deep despair,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Swift to her aid her mother came,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She pray'd for death, until the moon<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When, hark! without, what sudden sound!<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Some horseman must be near!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stops, he rings, Hark! as the noise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dies soft away, a well-known voice<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She lightly on the courser sprung,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Hark! as their rapid course they urge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A passing bell, a solemn dirge;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Hoarse ravens join the strain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They see a coffin on a bier,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A priest and mourners too appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Slow moving o'er the plain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And sad was heard the funeral lay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What the Lord gives, he takes away;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Life's but a fleeting shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"A tale that's told,&mdash;a flower that falls;<br /></span>

<span class="i1">"And bears us to his bed."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Forbear;"&mdash;imperious William cry'd<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While William speaks, they silent stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then run obedient to command,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But, on with furious bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The foaming courser forward flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fire and stones his heels pursue,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like whirlwinds dash'd around.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On right and left, on left and right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trees, hills, and towns flew past their sight,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But, soon with hurried steps, the crew<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Swifter than shafts, or than the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While struck from earth fire flash'd behind,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Affirm'd as much, some thousand years ago.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fontaine, in French, asserted just the same;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who then shall dare deny the reptile claim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To faculties, the world esteems so low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As scarce to notice, if you think or no?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Within a temple, where the builder's art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grandeur and elegance at once had join'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While due proportion, reign'd in every part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And simple grace, with solid strength combin'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In such a temple's wall, sat perch'd on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A solemn, thoughtful, philosophic fly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For flies, an air so grave, of wisdom take,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on one leg, the head will often hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And into wrinkles, oft the forehead fold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only because they deep reflection's make;<br /></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span><span class="i0">The source of all things here below.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus then, involv'd in contemplation deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With half a dozen wrinkles on his brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This fly began, around himself to peep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And question whence the building rose, and how?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No <i>maker</i> of this work can I perceive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth he&mdash;and that there is one, scarce believe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For who should such a maker be?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Art," said a spider sage. "Art built the work you see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, wheresoever turns your eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fix'd laws, and order you descry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hence, a fair conclusion grows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That from the hand of Art, the building rose."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">At this the fly, in his conceptions proud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laugh'd out aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a sneer of scorn, replied&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Most learned sir, I oft have tried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At this same Art to get a sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never on him yet could light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, the more I think, the more I find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your Art is but a fiction of the mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Now learn from me how this same temple grew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once on a time, it so by chance befel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That pebbles numberless together flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And settling, form'd this hollow shell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where you, and I, friend spider, dwell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, what can be more evidently true?"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A fly, for such a system, we forgive;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if great geniuses should live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who deem this world's well-order'd frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sprung from blind accident alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chance, as author of their lives proclaim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rather than bow to God's eternal throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sole excuse a creed, like this admits,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is, that its votaries have lost their wits.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So at the midnight hour draws nigh to the slumbering city<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pestilence. Couch'd on his broad spread wings lurks under the rampart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death, bale-breathing. As yet unalarmed are the peaceable dwellers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close to his nightly-lamp the sage yet watches; and high friends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over wine not unhallow'd, in shelter of odorous bowers,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span><span class="i0">Talk of the soul and of friendship, and weigh their immortal duration.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But too soon shall frightful Death, in a day of affliction<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pouncing over them, over them spread; in a day of moaning and anguish....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When with wringing of hands the bride for the bridegroom loud wails;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, now of all her children bereft, the desperate mother<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Furious curses the day on which she bore, and was born ... when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weary with hollower eye, amid the carcases totter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even the buriers ... till the sent Death-angel, descending,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thoughtful on thunder-clouds, beholds all lonesome and silent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazes the wide desolation, and long broods over the graves, fixt.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="smaller">"Perhaps some other writer will throw this fine picture into blank verse
so well, as to convince the public, that the beauties of Klopstock can be naturalized
without strangeness, and his peculiarities retained without affectation;
that quaintness, the unavoidable companion of neologism, is as needless
to genius, as hostile to grace; the hexameter, until it is familiar, must repel,
and, when it is familiar, may annoy; that it wants a musical orderliness of
sound; and that its cantering capricious movement opposes the grave march
of solemn majesty, and better suits the ordinary scenery of Theocritus than
the empyreal visions of Klopstock."<br />

poem, will induce us to give it place this month, altho we are already crowded
with materials. We think it our duty, as <i>Britons</i> and <i>Protestants</i>, to take
every opportunity of celebrating such an illustrious hero as the King of <i>Prussia</i>;
and, however unequal the strains may be thought, yet if they contribute
ever so little to raise an imitation of his noble and almost divine atchievments,
in the cause of <i>Religion</i> and <i>Liberty</i>, our end will be fully answered.</p>

<p class="smaller" style="padding-top: 2em">The King of Prussia employs himself in times of peace in the following
manner: He rises at five; on business till seven; dresses, and receives letters
and petitions till nine; from nine to eleven with his ministers; then on the
parade, to exercise the guards; dines at half an hour after twelve with some
of his officers; at half an hour after one he retires till five; then somebody
reads to him till seven; then the concert; at nine come the men of genius;
they sup half an hour after, and converse till eleven; then the king retires,
and at twelve goes to bed.&mdash;He is a statesman, soldier, author, and musician;
indefatigable in business; and by method overlooks and directs everything;
very frugal; without farce of state; the idle officers of the court have the
usual titles; but no pay for the drones, tho' they are mostly officers.</p>

<span class="i0">Give us, or withhold success;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trifles, when we <i>hope</i>, can cheer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trifles smite us when we fear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the flames that lovers know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trifles quench and trifles blow.<br /></span>

<p class="smaller" style="text-indent: 0em; padding-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 0em">Gentlemen.</p>

<p class="smaller" style="margin-top: 0em">The following small poetical performance was hastily composed at the request,
and for the entertainment, of a select company of publick spirited
friends, who gave me a short notice of their intention to dine with me, and
drink the protestant champion's health, as they termed the king of <i>Prussia</i>.
They were indulgent enough to express their unanimous approbation of the
piece, and insisted on my sending it up to you, in order (if you would be
of their opinion) to occupy a leaf in your <i>Magazine</i>. I hope no reader will
think the dignity of the subject, lessened merely by the familiar strain, in
which it is written: when they consider, that <i>such</i> seemed most suitable to
the occasion, the verses consisting of eleven feet, are to be read, like the
<i>Greek Iambics</i> (which were, anciently, much used in convivial festivities)
with less solemnity and more rapidity, than the common heroic measure of ten
feet in our language will admit.</p>

<span class="i0">Does <span class="smcap">Fred'rick's</span> smile my wand'ring steps embrace?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does his great soul possess'd of wisdom's balm,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Which time secures, the most impartial friend,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">E'en <i>India's</i> Kings receiv'd the willing yoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For goodness is a band no savage broke!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Not <i>Salem's</i> walls defil'd with wilful blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A crime, her victor's clemency withstood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not all her honours levell'd with the dust,<br /></span>

THE ALPS, WITH AN AFFECTING<br />
ANECDOTE.</p>


<p class="smaller">But to return to our Alps. Here, savage rocks of an inaccessible height;
there, torrents bursting, as it were, from the clouds, and rolling down the
rugged precipices:</p>


<p class="smaller"><span style="padding-left: 14em">The gay train,</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 10em">Of fog, thick roll'd into romantic shape,</span><br />
may, perhaps, excite your wonder, but not exceed the compass of your imagination.
But how shall I convey to you an idea of the ever-varying and
accidental beauties of this majestic scenery! Sometimes the vapour-winged
tempest, flitting along some lonely vale, embrowns it with a solemn shade,
whilst every thing around glitters in the fullness of meridian splendour. On
a sudden, all is dark and gloomy; the thunder rolls from rock to rock, till
echo seems tired with the dreadful repetition: add to this, the gradual approach
of the evening, the last gleam of sunshine fading on the mountain-brow,
the lingering twilight still warding off the veil of night, till the rising
moon just continues, in vision, a glimmering of its faded glories:</p>

<p class="smaller">A Danish Ballad. By the Author of Alonzo the Brave.</p>

<p>[The poem follows.]</p>

<p class="smaller">Since writing these stanzas, I have met with two old Scotch ballads which
have some resemblance with "The Water King"; one is called "May
Colvin," and relates the story of a king's daughter who was beguiled from
her father's house by a false Sir John; the other, intitled "Clerk Colvil,"
treats of a young man who fell into the snares of a false mermaid; the latter,
indeed, bears a still stranger resemblance to the Danish tradition of "The
Erl-King's Daughter." The fragment of "The Water King" may be found
in "Herder's Volkslieder."</p>

<p class="smaller">Many inquiries have been made respecting the elementary monarchs mentioned
a few pages back; I must inform my readers that all I know respecting
the Water King (called in the German translation "Der Wasser-Mann")
and the Erl-King (called in German Erlk&ouml;nig) is gathered from the foregoing
ballad and two others which I shall here insert. With respect to the
Fire King and the Cloud King, they are entirely of my own creation; but if
my readers choose to ascribe their birth to the "Comte de Gabalis," they are
very welcome.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The conflict's o'er&mdash;ah! lovely maid, adieu!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before these sad, these parting lines, you view;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the fields with early dawn shall bloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your Werter rests beneath the silent tomb:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more to view the beauties of the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more to listen to thy heavenly lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sit, in transport, and to hear thee talk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or with thee wander, in an ev'ning walk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the margin of the winding flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thro' the green fields, or in the shady wood.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">O! Charlotte! when you see the floods arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wintry storms descending from the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wat'ry gloom that fills the plain below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all around one dreary waste of snow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will you not then, a sigh in sorrow heave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the lost pleasures of a summer's eve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recall the time when you so oft have seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy hapless lover on the verdant green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or thro' the vale approaching from the grove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To view thy charms and pine in hopeless love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gaze on thy angel form, for without she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world appear'd a boundless blank to me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when to seamen, from the midnight skies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon's bright beams in brilliant glory rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To guide them wand'ring thro' the wat'ry plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or land them on their native shores again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, Charlotte, I no other joy could see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than pass the vacant day, and gaze on thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live in thy joys, or in thy sorrows die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And drink delicious poison from thine eye,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the lost insect round the taper flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And courts the fatal flame by which it dies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, Charlotte, now those fleeting joys are fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Werter sinks among the silent dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the bright hopes of life forever gone,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span><span class="i0">His mem'ry lost, and e'en his name unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The time shall come, when in the vacant mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fondest friend no trace of me shall find;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When e'en my kindred my sad fate shall hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And view my mould'ring grave without a tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think on the light impressions of the mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which flee as midnight dreams, and leave no trace behind.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">This eve I wander'd thro' each beauteous scene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each fertile valley, and each level green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pensive and sad I view'd the foaming flood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wild winds disturb the silent wood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld the sun's great orb, in glory bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Descend behind the western surge in night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While on the hill to see its beams, I stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And view'd it sinking in the briny flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I felt my heart with double sorrows prest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And life's last hope desert my throbbing breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world's vast scene forever clos'd from sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all involv'd in one eternal night.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ah! shall I ne'er again thy image know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In these sad realms of misery and woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or is there yet a place in heaven design'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For hapless mortals by th' eternal mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some winding valley, or some shady grove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some blissful mansions in the realms above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Charlotte's shade and mine may one day meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our suff'rings ended and our bliss complete,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the bright regions of eternal light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where all is perfect joy and pure delight.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When in the summer's eve you chance to stray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thro' the low vale, or on the broad highway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or in the churchyard, thro' the shady trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You hear the whistling of the midnight breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wave high the grass, in solitary gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around the heap that shews thy lover's tomb&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, then will you not one sad thought bestow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On him who could no greater blessing know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than pass the hour with fleeting joys with thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gaze on thy charms and watch thy wand'ring eye,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span><span class="i0">Observe the beauteous image of thy mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disclose a soul for heaven alone design'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or view thy distant form amidst the trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thy white tresses floating in the breeze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or see thy fingers strike, with tender lays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such notes as bards in heaven alone can raise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such notes as Orpheus' self might lean to hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And force from Pluto's soul the melting tear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, Charlotte's self, my sad remains shall see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Charlotte's tender heart will heave a sigh for me.<br /></span>

<p class="smaller">Among the newest and most delightful miscellanies, lately received from
England, may be ranked a poetical work, entitled "<i>Tales of Terror</i>." This
is partly intended as a burlesque of the various ballads in Lewis's celebrated
romance, "<i>The Monk</i>." We well remember, that this member of the British
parliament has amused himself, and alarmed his readers, by resorting to the
cells of Gothic superstition, and invoking all the forms of German horror,
to appal every timid heart. Hence, we have been haunted by ghosts of all
complexions; and "<i>Cloud Kings</i>," and "<i>Water Kings</i>," and "<i>Fire Kings</i>,"
have been crowned by this poetical magician, to rule with despotism in the
realms of Fancy. A lively satirist, endowed with the gifts of Genius, easy
in versification, pleasant in his humour, and inimitably successful in parody,
has, in some of his "<i>Tales of Terror</i>" undertaken to mock the doleful tones
of Mr. Lewis's muse, or shall we rather say the hoarse caw of the German
raven. The midnight hour has been beguiled, by transcribing the following
sarcasm, founded on a well-known nursery story, and our readers will thank
us for sitting up so late for their amusement.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p class="smaller">["se feel" (stanza I). "se" is no Dutch word and the verb "feel"
(voelen) is not reflexive in Dutch. In stanzas III and VI "mill" appears
in the place of "will." This is most likely a misprint, since "<i>w</i> in Dutch is
a particularly tenacious sound" and is not replaced by <i>m</i>, as is sometimes
the case in German. "Brokenbrooks" is a coined word.</p>

are the legitimate offspring of genius. We are conducted by a versatile guide,
sometimes into the vale of tears, and sometimes into the hall of mirth. But
let him lead us where he will, we cheerfully follow and always find ourselves
with a sensible and tuneful companion. I am half inclined to suspect that
Mr. Lewis himself is the concealed author. We know how he brilliantly
travestied his own ballad, Alonzo the Brave, and it is probable that in this
collection he is alter et idem.</p>

<span class="i0">To thee the dreadful recompense belongs&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thy just vengeance I consign my wrongs;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When each well-known scene crowded fast on my sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And Hope's glowing visions came warm to my soul.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Through the pine-grove I hastened with footsteps of air<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Already my lov'd ones I felt in embrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I came&mdash;of my cot not a vestige was there&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But a hilloc of snow was heap'd high in its place.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The heart-rending story too soon did I hear&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">An avalanche, loosed from the near mountain's side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our cottage o'erwhelmed in its thundering career,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And beneath it my wife and my children had died.<br /></span>

<p class="smaller" style="padding-top: 2em">To those who have admired the singular poems of Lewis, Walter Scott, and
others, under the whimsical titles of "The Cloud-King," "The Fire-King,"
etc., the following burlesque ballad may afford some amusement.</p>

<p class="poemtitle">THE PAINT-KING.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fair Ellen, was once the delight of the young;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No damsel could with her compare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her charms were the theme of the heart and the tongue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bards without number in extacies sung<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The beauties of Ellen, the Fair.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Ellen, though lovers in regiments threw<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The darts of their eyes at her heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the sorrow no pitying sympathy knew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, cold as an icicle-shower, they drew<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Not a drop from that petrified part.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet still did the heart of fair Ellen implore<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A something that could not be found;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a sailor it seem'd on a desolate shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With nor house, nor a tree, nor a sound, but the roar<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of breakers high-dashing around.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From object to object, still, still would she stray<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Yet nothing, alas! could she find;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through Novelty's mazes she rambled all day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even at midnight, so restless, they say,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In sleep would run after the wind.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nay, rather than sit like a statue so still,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When the rain made her mansion a pound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up and down would she go like the sails of a mill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pat every stair, like a wood-pecker's bill,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From the tiles of the roof to the ground.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One morn, as the maid from her casement reclin'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Pass'd a youth with a frame in his hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The casement she clos'd; not the eye of her mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For do all she could, no, she could not be blind;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span><span class="i1">Still before her she saw the youth stand.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And what can he do," said the maid with a sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Ah! what with that frame can he do?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wish I could know it." When suddenly by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The youth pass'd again; and again did her eye<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The frame, and a sweet picture view.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh! sweet, lovely picture!" the fair Ellen sigh'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"I must see thee again or I die;"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then under her white chin her bonnet she tied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after the youth and the picture she hied,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Till the youth, looking back, met her eye.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Fair damsel," said he (and he chuckled the while),<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"This picture, I see, you admire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then take it, I beg you, perhaps 'twill beguile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some moments of sorrow: (pray pardon my smile)<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or, at least, keep you home by the fire."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Ellen the gift, with delight and surprise,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From the cunning young stripling receiv'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she knew not the poison that enter'd her eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When beaming with rapture they gazed on her prize:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Yet thus was fair Ellen deceiv'd!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas a youth o'er the form of a statue inclin'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the sculptor he seem'd of the stone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet he languish'd, as though for its beauty he pin'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gaz'd, as the eyes of the statue so blind<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Reflected the beams of his own.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas the tale of the sculptor, Pygmalion of old;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fair Ellen remember'd and sigh'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ah! could'st thou but lift from that marble so cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thine eyes so enchanting, thy arms should enfold,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And press me this day as thy bride."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She said: when, behold, from the canvass arose<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The youth ... and he stepp'd from the frame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a furious joy, his arms did enclose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The love-plighted Ellen; and, clasping, he froze<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span><span class="i1">The blood of the maid with his flame!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She turn'd and beheld on each shoulder a wing<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Oh! heaven!" cried she, "who art thou?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the roof to the ground did his fierce answer ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When frowning, he thunder'd, "I am the Paint-King!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And mine, lovely maid, thou art now!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then high from the ground did the grim monster lift<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The loud-screaming maid, like a blast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he sped through the air, like a meteor swift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the clouds, wand'ring by him, did fearfully drift<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To the right and the left as he pass'd.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, suddenly sloping his hurricane flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With an eddying whirl he descends;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The air all below him becomes black as night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the ground where he treads, as if mov'd with affright,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like the surge of the Caspian bends.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I am here!" said the fiend, and he thundering knock'd<br /></span>
<span class="i1">At the gates of a mountainous cave:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gates open'd wide, as by magick unlock'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the peaks of the mount, reeling to and fro, rock'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like an island of ice on the wave.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh! mercy!" cried Ellen, and swoon'd in his arms.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But the Paint-King, he scoff'd at her pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Prithee, love," said the monster, "what mean these alarms?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She hears not, she sees not the terrible charms<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That wake her to horror again.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She opens her lids; but no longer her eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Behold the fair youth she would woo:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now appears the Paint-King in his natural guise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His face, like a palette of villainous dies,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Black and white, red and yellow, and blue.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On a bright polish'd throne, of prismatical<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> spar,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sat the mosaick fiend like a clod;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span><span class="i0">While he rear'd in his mouth a gigantick cigar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twice as big as the light-house, though seen from afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On the coast of the stormy Cape Cod.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And anon, as he puff'd the vast volumes, were seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In horrid festoons on the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Legs and arms, head and bodies, emerging between;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the drawing room grim of the Scotch Sawney Beane,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">By the Devil dress'd out for a ball.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ah me!" cried the damsel, and fell at his feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Must I hang on these walls to be dried?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh, no!" said the fiend, while he sprung from his seat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"A far nobler fortune thy person shall meet;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Into paint will I grind thee, my bride!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then, seizing the maid by her dark auburn hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">An oil-jug he plung'd her within.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seven days, seven nights, with the shrieks of despair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did Ellen in torment convulse the dim air,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All cover'd with oil to the chin.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On the morn of the eighth on a huge sable stone<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then Ellen, all reeking, he laid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a rock for his muller, he crush'd every bone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But though ground to jelly, still, still did she groan;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For life had forsook not the maid.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now reaching his palette with masterly care,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Each tint on the surface he spread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blue of her eyes, and the brown of her hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pearl and the white of her forehead so fair<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And her lips' and her cheeks' rosy red.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then stamping his foot, did the monster exclaim,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Now I brave, cruel Fairy, thy scorn!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When lo! from a chasm unfathom'd there came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A small tiny chariot of rose-colour'd flame,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span><span class="i1">By a team of ten glowworms upborne.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Enthron'd in the midst on an emerald bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fair Geraldine sat without peer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her robe was the gleam of the first blush of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her mantle the fleece of a noon-cloud white,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And a beam of the moon was her spear.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In a voice that stole on the still charmed air,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like the first gentle accent of Eve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus spake from her chariot the Fairy so fair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I come at thy call ... but, oh Paint-King! beware,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Beware if again you deceive."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tis true," said the monster, "thou queen of my heart!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thy portrait I oft have essay'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet ne'er to the canvass could I with my art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The least of thy wonderful beauties impart;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And my failure with scorn you repaid.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now I swear, by the light of the Comet-King's tail!"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And he tower'd with pride as he spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"If again with these magical colours I fail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crater of Etna shall hence be my jail,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And my food shall be sulphur and smoke.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But if I succeed, then, oh! fair Geraldine!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thy promise with rapture, I claim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou, queen of Fairies, shalt ever be mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bride of my bed; and thy portrait divine<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Shall fill all the earth with my fame."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He spake; when, behold the fair Geraldine's form<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On the canvass enchantingly glow'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His touches, they flew like the leaves in a storm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the pure, pearly white, and the carnation warm,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Contending in harmony, flow'd.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now did the portrait a twin-sister seem<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To the figure of Geraldine fair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the same sweet expression did faithfully teem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each muscle, each feature; in short, not a gleam<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span><span class="i1">Was lost of her beautiful hair.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas the Fairy herself! but, alas! her blue eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Still a pupil did ruefully lack;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who shall describe the terrifick surprise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That seized the Paint-King, when, behold, he descries<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Not a speck on his palette of black.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I am lost!" said the fiend, and he shook like a leaf;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When, casting his eyes to the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw the lost pupils of Ellen with grief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the jaws of a mouse, and the sly little thief<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whisk away from his sight with a bound.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I am lost!" said the fiend, and he fell like a stone:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then rising the Fairy in ire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a touch of her finger she loosen'd her zone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(While the limbs on the wall gave a terrible groan!)<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And she swell'd to a column of fire.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her spear now a thunder-bolt flash'd in the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And sulphur the vault fill'd around:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She smote the grim monster; and now by the hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High lifting, she hurl'd him in speechless despair<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Down the depths of the chasm profound.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then waving, with smiles, o'er the picture her spear,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Come forth!" said the good Geraldine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, behold, from the canvass fair Ellen appear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In feature, in person more lovely than e'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With grace more than ever divine!<br /></span>
